Customer Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing customer data from a CSV file and performing various data transformations and analysis tasks. The code is written in Python using libraries such as pandas, SQLAlchemy, and matplotlib.
Introduction

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate data analysis techniques using Python. The code reads customer data from a CSV file, performs data transformations, and analyzes the data by calculating the average age and plotting the age distribution. It also includes a step to connect to a PostgreSQL database to load the transformed data.

Installation

To run this code locally, you need to have the following installed:

Python 
pandas library (install with pip install pandas)
SQLAlchemy library (install with pip install SQLAlchemy)
matplotlib library (install with pip install matplotlib)

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

Usage

Place your CSV file containing customer data in the same directory as the code file.
Update the path in the code to match the location of your CSV file.
Ensure that you have a PostgreSQL database set up with the necessary credentials and connection details. Adjust the connection string in the code to match your database configuration.
Run the code file data_analysis.py using a Python IDE or command line.
Results

After running the code, the average age of the customers will be calculated and displayed. Additionally, a histogram plot will be generated, showing the distribution of ages among the customers. The transfo
